## Create a gAPI

You are tasked with building an API that future gSchool students can use to practice their AJAX skills.

### Instructions

Fork and clone this repository. Choose any topic that requires at least two resources. For example:

* Local Community Supported Agriculture groups (CSAs)
* Small Businesses for a particular community
* Online Code & Design Resources

Create RESTful routes for the associated resources making sure to validate the incoming information and sensibly structuring the data coming out. Don't concern yourself with aggregating too much data -- the idea is that users will be submitting the data!

Create a simple web page marketing your API that mentions the various routes. For inspiration:

* [OMDB API](http://omdbapi.com/)
* [Pokeapi](http://pokeapi.co/)
* [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)

Deploy your website!

### Stretch Goals

Once you have a working API, there's a ton more you can do to make it fully featured. Some suggestions include:

* Add testing to ensure your API continues to work throughout the changes.
* Create a table that includes APIKeys that you can distribute to users. Require these keys to make modifications to the data.
* Create a JavaScript wrapper for your API and publish as an NPM package.
